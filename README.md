This project is to create a cnn model to predict the mnist image
1)The dataset used to create this model is google's tf.data.mnist 
2)This dataset contains mnist images of hand wriiten numbers from 0 to 9 which size are (28,28).
3)The model is a deep learning Dense model
4)The overall accuracy of the model is 97%
5)The dataset is also provided in this project as .npz file
6)To run the project run the test.py file, before that install the project dependencies by using given requirements.txt file
by command "pip install -r requirements.txt"
7)The project will automatically creates a test dataset from the .npz file and randomly choose a image from the dataset and use the image to predict the class
8) No manual testing needed, if you want to manually test on some other random images go on and make sure you change the code for the manual testing
